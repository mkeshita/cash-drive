        When a user makes an application by submitting their contact information
        using our website, the information we collect will be used to contact
        the user. The personal information and other information we collect from
        a user will be used to evaluate the applicant’s eligibility to obtain a
        credit facility with us.

        The information provided to us by a user may be shared by our partners
        such as the Credit Bureaus in order to process the user’s credit
        history. Your information is only disclosed to partners that have been
        bound by confidentiality obligations and/or regulatory compliance.

        Financial information such as your BVN number is used to verify that the
        individual applying for a CashDrive loan is the same as the owner of the
        bank account provided. This is to ensure that a user’s details cannot be
        used to apply for a loan without their authorization in the event of a
        third party having access to their account information. Your BVN does
        not provide access to your bank account(s). We always encourage our
        applicants to confirm from their banks before using our service.

        We take all precautions to protect every user’s information. The
        information submitted to CashDrive by users is protected and available
        only to our customer care agents or service representatives, who are
        trained and up to date on current security and privacy practices.

        Our goal is to minimize intrusiveness and maximize the protection of
        your personal information. When you provide your personal information
        through the CashDrive website, be assured that your information is
        secure & discreet.
